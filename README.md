# Summary

The goal is to create a usable interface where the input is a url of a product page or reviews page on Amazon and the output is a summary of it's reviews with careful attention to what users did and didn't like about it. In the backend, it should utilize an LLM. There is lots of room for customization, but for now, that is our goal.

## To Do:
* Write code / Learn how to scrape reviews from Amazon 
* Construct a function that can input a sequence of reviews and return a summary of them.
